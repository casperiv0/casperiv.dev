## The hook

Check if your component has mounted. This can be useful if you're using server side rendering.

```tsx title="src/hooks/useMounted.ts"
import * as React from "react";

export function useMounted() {
  const [isMounted, setMounted] = React.useState(false);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    setMounted(true);

    return () => {
      setMounted(false);
    };
  }, []);

  return isMounted;
}
```

## npm/yarn

You can now also use this hook via npm/yarn by installing [my npm package](https://npm.im/@casperiv/useful):

```bash --command=true
npm install @casperiv/useful
```

Later in your project

```tsx
import { useMounted } from "@casperiv/useful/hooks/useMounted";
```
