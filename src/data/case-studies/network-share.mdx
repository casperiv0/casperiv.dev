## Introduction

[Network Share](https://github.com/dev-caspertheghost/network-share) is a web app to share files, images, videos,
etc across the same network in realtime.

**GitHub Repository:** [Open GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dev-caspertheghost/network-share)

## Idea

The idea for Network Share was to create a web application that one could drop files, images, videos, etc onto a "drop-zone"
so it can be shared easily across the same network. It had to be very simple to use and had to be in realtime.

## Future ideas

I currently don't have any future ideas/plans for this project. It doesn't need much to function either way ðŸ˜…!

## Technologies

Network Share is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for the client and [Express](https://expressjs.com) with [socket.io](https://socket.io) for the API.
Express handles the file uploads since socket.io wasn't able to handle large file uploads unfortunately.

For the API I am using an class based approach to handle socket events. This keeps the API organized and structured.
