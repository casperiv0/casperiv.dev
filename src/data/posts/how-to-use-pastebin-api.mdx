`pastebin-api` is a npm package I created to interact with the [Pastebin API](https://pastebin.com/doc_api) to create pastes, list pastes and delete pastes.
It has a very intuitive API and is very easy to use.

## Installation

```bash --command=true
npm install pastebin-api
```

## Creating the client

Firstly, we must import the `PasteClient` class from the package:

```typescript title="src/index.ts"
import { PasteClient } from "pastebin-api";
```

### Initializing the client

Secondly, we must initialize the client with your [API key](https://pastebin.com/doc_api#1) from your [pastebin account](https://pastebin.com/login)

```typescript title="src/index.ts" {3}
import { PasteClient } from "pastebin-api";

const client = new PasteClient(process.env.PASTEBIN_API_KEY);
```

<Info title="Securely storing the Pastebin API token">

    To securely store your Pastebin API token, I recommend you create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following line to it:

```bash
PASTEBIN_API_KEY="REPLACE_ME"
```

<p />

## Creating a new paste

Now we'll create a new paste using the [`.createPaste`](https://github.com/Dev-CasperTheGhost/pastebin-api/blob/main/docs/README.md#create-a-paste) method:

```typescript title="src/index.ts" {5-14} /Publicity, ExpireDate/
import { PasteClient, Publicity, ExpireDate } from "pastebin-api";

const client = new PasteClient(process.env.PASTEBIN_API_KEY);

const pasteUrl = await client.createPaste({
  code: "const something = 'Hello World!'",
  expireDate: ExpireDate.Never,
  format: "javascript",
  name: "something.js",
  publicity: Publicity.Public,
});

console.log(pasteUrl); // if an error occurred, it'll be thrown to the console.
```

- `code`: The code we want to send in the Paste
- `expireDate`: When should the paste expire?
- `format`: The format, "javascript", "java", "lua", etc
- `name`: The name of the paste
- `publicity`: Whether a paste should be public, unlisted or private

## Woohoo ðŸŽ‰

There you have it! We've successfully created a new paste! [Read more on the docs](https://github.com/Dev-CasperTheGhost/pastebin-api/blob/main/docs/README.md)
