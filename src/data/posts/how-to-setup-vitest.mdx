## Requirements

- Node.js installed with **v18 or higher**
- Basic Node.js app

## What is Vitest?

Vitest is a fast and simple testing framework for Node.js, React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, etc.
It's built on top of Vite, which is a fast build tool for JavaScript and TypeScript.
Vitest is also compatible with Jest, which is another popular testing framework.

## Installation

Firstly, we will install Vitest as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev vitest
```

## Configuring the project

To run tests with Vitest, we need to add a script to our `package.json`. We will call it `test`:

```json {5}
{
  "name": "my-nodejs-app",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest"
  }
}
```

## Adding a test file

Now that we have added the test script, we can start adding test files. Vitest will by default search for files ending with `.test.js` or `.test.ts`.
Let's create a file called `math.test.ts` in the `src` folder:

```ts title="maths.test.ts"
import { expect, test } from "vitest";

test("Math.sqrt()", () => {
  expect(Math.sqrt(4)).toBe(2);
  expect(Math.sqrt(144)).toBe(12);
  expect(Math.sqrt(2)).toBe(Math.SQRT2);
});
```

If you're not familiar with the `test` and `expect` functions, they allow use write assertions and tests. In simple terms:

- `test`: Run a test with a name and a function.
- `expect`: Make sure that the value is equal to the expected value.

## Running the tests

To run these tests, simply run the `test` command we created earlier:

```bash --command=true
npm run test
```

This will show all passed and failed tests.

  **Tip:** You can also view the test results in the browser by adding the `--ui` flag to the `test` command:

```json {4}
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest",
    "test:ui": "vitest --ui"
  }
}
```

## More from Vitest

You can use Vitest for many more project types, such as: React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, etc.

Personally, I use Vitest in many of my projects and I absolutely love it! It's simple to set up, fast and has a great community.
