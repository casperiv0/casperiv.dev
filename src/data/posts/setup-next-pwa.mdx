intro: How to setup next-pwa with Next.js in less than 5 minutes.
---

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure that you already have a Next.js app with version 9 or higher.

## Getting started

To get started we will install the required [npm package](https://npm.im/next-pwa).

```bash
npm i next-pwa
```

If you already have a `next.config.js` file, you will need to wrap your configs with the `withNextPWA` function:

```javascript:next.config.js
const withNextPWA = require("next-pwa")

module.exports = withNextPWA({
  /*
    ...
    Rest of the config here
    ...
  */
})
```

<Alert style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }} type="info">
  Tip: You can create a `manifest.json` file in your `public` folder. This file will hold the rest
  of your [PWA configuration](https://web.dev/add-manifest/).
</Alert>

## Configuring next-pwa

We need to add a few more options in our Next.js config to properly setup next-pwa.
We also need to disable next-pwa for `development` to avoid [this weird error](#weird-error).

```javascript:next.config.js
const withNextPWA = require("next-pwa")

module.exports = withNextPWA({
  /*
    ...
    Rest of the config here
    ...
  */
  pwa: {
    // disable for development.
    disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development",
    dest: "public"
    /** View more options here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-pwa#available-options */
  }
})
```

## Usage

When building your next app (`next build`). This will automatically pick up the next-pwa configuration and build the PWA too.
Once it's done building, you should see 2 new files in your `public` folder created by next-pwa.

<Alert style={{ margin: "1.5rem 0" }} type="info">
  Tip: Add these files to a `.gitignore` to avoid conflicts when using version control.
</Alert>

## Weird Error

If you're in `development` and run into the following issues:

- Very slow page loads
- Development server hanging
- `pages is undefined` errors

This can mean that there's a service worker registered. For some reason this can break the Next.js development server.
To unregister this service worker, do the following steps below:

1. Open your DevTools (<kbd>F12</kbd>)
2. Find the `Application` tab
3. Open the `Service Workers` tab in the sidebar
4. Unregister all service workers
