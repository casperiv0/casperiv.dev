In this article, you will learn how to create an npm package. We will use [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) to build our package, it allows us to easily output <abbr title="ECMAScript modules">ESM</abbr> and <abbr title="CommonJS">CJS</abbr> code together with our TypeScript types. We will also be using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to write our code.

## Project Setup

Firstly, we will create a folder for our project and initialize the project with `npm`.

```bash
mkdir my-project && cd my-project && npm init -y
```

This will create a `package.json` file for us. Now, we can install the necessary development dependencies:

```bash
npm i -D tsup typescript @types/node
```

While it is installing the dependencies, we can create a `src` folder and a `src/index.ts` file.

```bash
mkdir src && touch src/index.ts
```

Now, we can add the following code to `src/index.ts`:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
// replace this with actual code later ;)
export function hello(name: string) {
  return `Hello ${name}!`;
}
```

## Tooling Setup

### TypeScript configuration

Now that we have our project setup, we can add TypeScript to our project. Start by creating a `tsconfig.json` file:

```bash
touch tsconfig.json
```

Now, simply add the following configuration to our `tsconfig.json` file:

_**Tip:** you can also add more configuration options to this file if necessary._

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "target": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "declaration": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  },
  "exclude": ["dist", "node_modules"]
}
```

### Package scripts

Now that we have our project setup, we can add the following scripts to our `package.json` file:

```json title="package.json" {4-5}
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsup",
    "dev": "tsup --watch"
  }
}
```

- **build**: This will build our package and output it to the `dist` folder.
- **dev**: This will build our package and watch for changes.

### npm config

Now that we have our project setup, we can add the following `exports` and `type` to our `package.json` file. This will allow users to use both ESM and CJS versions of our package.

```json title="package.json" {7-15}
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsup",
    "dev": "tsup --watch"
  },
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
      "import": "./dist/index.js",
      "require": "./dist/index.cjs"
    },
    "./package.json": "./package.json"
  }
}
```

<Info title="ESM Only?!">
  **Nope!** This package is **not** ESM only. You may have noticed we added the `"type": "module"`
  but this is only for the `package.json` file. We also added the `"exports"` field, which will
  allow us to use both ESM and CJS versions of our package.
</Info>

### tsup configuration

Once the scripts have been added, we have to add the following `tsup` configuration to our `package.json` file:

```json title="package.json" {16-23}
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsup",
    "dev": "tsup --watch"
  },
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
      "import": "./dist/index.js",
      "require": "./dist/index.cjs"
    },
    "./package.json": "./package.json"
  },
  "tsup": {
    "dts": true,
    "bundle": false,
    "treeshake": true,
    "target": "node18",
    "format": ["esm", "cjs"],
    "entry": ["src/**/*.ts"]
  }
}
```

- **dts**: This will generate `*.d.ts` files for our package. These will be used to provide type support for our package.
- **bundle**: Setting this to `false` will prevent `tsup` from bundling our package into a single file.
- **target**: Make sure the output code is compatible with Node.js v18 or higher.
- **format**: This will generate both ESM and CJS versions of our package.
- **entry**: The entry files to our package.

## Publishing

To publish our package, login to your [npm](https://npmjs.com) account.

```bash
npm login
```

Now, we can publish our package.

```bash
npm publish
```

## That's it!

Now, we have successfully created an npm package with tsup for Node.js with ESM, CJS and, types support.
