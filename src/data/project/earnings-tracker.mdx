## Introduction

Earnings Tracker is a web application built to track my income and expenses. Being a student in Belgium,
I'm only allowed to work a certain amount of hours per month and earn a certain amount of money per year.
Therefore, I found it important to keep track of these elements.
I also wanted to make sure I wasn't spending too much money, so I decided to track my expenses as well.

Overtime I added many more features to this app so that I could use it as my main expense and income tracker.
I'm now able to select categories for expenses and added support for tracking working hours which I'm all able to visualize in the dashboard.

## Technologies

Earnings Tracker is built using Next.js and tRPC. Before this project,
I had never used tRPC before so I was excited to try it out. I had also heard a lot of great things about tRPC.
TypeScript is used since it's my go-to language for web & mobile applications.

- Next.js
