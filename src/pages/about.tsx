            Hello, I am Casper! {"I'm"} a <Age /> year old programmer and student based in Belgium.
            I adore building accessible and fast code. {"I'm"} also a big fan of open-source, I
            contribute to open-source as much as I can, I also have{" "}

          </p>
          <p className="mt-5">
            I have been developing web applications, Discord bots and npm packages for about 2 years
            and love it! {"I'm"} learning something new almost every day! I am currently focusing on
            frontend web development. Specifically working with React.js, TypeScript, CSS, HTML and
            much more!
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5">
            I also like interacting with GitHub repositories to expand my knowledge about
            technologies and web development in general.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5">
            When {"I'm"} not programming or in school, I enjoy to go mountain biking in my local
            town. I also love skiing!
